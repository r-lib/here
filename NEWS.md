- `dr_here()` shows the initial and current working directory (#18, #55).

## Documentation

- Improve readme and add "Getting started" vignette (#44, @sharlagelfand). Extend "Getting started" vignette with a detailed description of the behavior and use cases (#55).
- Update `?here` to address conflict with `lubridate::here()` (#37, @nzgwynn).
- New "rmarkdown" vignette (#55).
- `set_here()` is superseded in favor of `here::i_am()` (#61).
- More explicit documentation for the `...` argument to `here()` (#7).

## Internal

- Add testthat tests (#57).
- Use GitHub Actions for checks (#52).
- Requires rprojroot >= 2.0.1.
- Re-license as MIT (#50).
- Added Jennifer Bryan as contributor (#32).


# here 0.1 (2017-01-25)

Initial CRAN release.

- Main function `here()`
    - Uses a fixed root that contains a `.here` file or can be either an RStudio project, an R package, a `remake` project, a Projectile project, or a VCS repository.
    - The root is established at package loading time, and shown with a message.
    - The current working directory is used as a fallback.
- The `set_here()` function creates a `.here` file so that a directory is recognized as root by `here()`.
- The `dr_here()` function explains the reasoning of `here()` for the current session.
