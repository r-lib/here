The goal of the here package is to enable easy file referencing. In contrast to using `setwd()`, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, here uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.

## Installation

Install the released version of here from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("here")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/here")
```

## Usage

The here package creates paths relative to the top-level directory. The package displays the top-level of the current project on load or any time you call `here()`:

```{r}
library(here)
here()
```

You can build a path relative to the top-level directory in order to read or write a file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
here("files", "data", "iris.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(iris, here("files", "data", "iris.csv"))
```

These relative paths work regardless of where the associated source file lives inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different subdirectories.
