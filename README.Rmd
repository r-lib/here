The goal of the here package is to enable easy file referencing in [project-oriented workflows](https://rstats.wtf/projects.html).
In contrast to using `setwd()`, which is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, here uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.

## Installation

Install the released version of here from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("here")
```


## Usage

The here package creates paths relative to the top-level directory. The package displays the top-level of the current project on load or any time you call `here()`:

```{r}
here::i_am("README.Rmd")
here()
```

You can build a path relative to the top-level directory in order to read or write a file:

```{r}
here("inst", "demo-project", "data", "penguins.csv")
readr::write_csv(palmerpenguins::penguins, here("inst", "demo-project", "data", "penguins.csv"))
```

These relative paths work regardless of where the associated source file lives inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports in different subdirectories.
See the included [demo project](https://github.com/r-lib/here/tree/main/inst/demo-project) for an example.
