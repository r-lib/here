# here

The goal of the here package is to enable easy file referencing in
[project-oriented workflows](https://rstats.wtf/projects.html). In
contrast to using [`setwd()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/getwd.html), which
is fragile and dependent on the way you organize your files, here uses
the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files.

## Installation

Install the released version of here from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("here")
```

## Usage

The here package creates paths relative to the top-level directory. The
package displays the top-level of the current project on load or any
time you call [`here()`](https://here.r-lib.org/dev/reference/here.md):

``` r
here::i_am("README.Rmd")
#> here() starts at /Users/kirill/git/R/r-lib/here
here()
#> [1] "/Users/kirill/git/R/r-lib/here"
```

You can build a path relative to the top-level directory in order to
read or write a file:

``` r
here("inst", "demo-project", "data", "penguins.csv")
#> [1] "/Users/kirill/git/R/r-lib/here/inst/demo-project/data/penguins.csv"
readr::write_csv(palmerpenguins::penguins, here("inst", "demo-project", "data", "penguins.csv"))
```

These relative paths work regardless of where the associated source file
lives inside your project, like analysis projects with data and reports
in different subdirectories. See the included [demo
project](https://github.com/r-lib/here/tree/main/inst/demo-project) for
an example.
